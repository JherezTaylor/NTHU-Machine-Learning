# NTHU-Machine-Learning

NTHU EE6550 Machine Learning slides and my code solutions for spring semester 2017.

## Notes
- The assignments are mainly required to implement the ML/DL algorithms **from scratch** without using high-level library like `scikit-learn`.
There will be 5 assignments and each is coded with `python/numpy`.
- Since the course is still on-going, I won't upload the answers of the assignments until each of their deadlines is passed.
