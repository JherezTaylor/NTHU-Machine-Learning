# NTHU-Machine-Learning

NTHU EE6550 Machine Learning slides and my code solutions for spring semester 2017.

## Notes
- The assignments are mainly required to implement the ML/DL algorithms **from scratch** without using high-level library like `scikit-learn`, all are coded with `python/numpy`.

## Assignments
- [PAC Learning Rectangle](https://github.com/YuChunLOL/NTHU-Machine-Learning/tree/master/assignments/hw1-PAC-learning-rectangle)
- [Linear SVM](https://github.com/YuChunLOL/NTHU-Machine-Learning/tree/master/assignments/hw2-linear-svm): Linear Support Vector Machine for Binary Classification trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization.
- [Kernel SVM and Adaboost](https://github.com/YuChunLOL/NTHU-Machine-Learning/tree/master/assignments/hw3-kernel-svm-and-adaboost)
  - An Extension of HW2 linear SVM.
  - Adaboost classifer with the shallow decision tree (depth 1) for binary classification.
- [Kernel SVR](https://github.com/YuChunLOL/NTHU-Machine-Learning/tree/master/assignments/hw4-kernel-svr): Support Vector Regression, trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization.
- [Neural Network](https://github.com/YuChunLOL/NTHU-Machine-Learning/tree/master/assignments/hw5-neural-network): A simple neural network trained with SGD for regression.
